# GAME TITLE [WORK IN PROCESS]
A Subnautica-eqsue survival on an alien planet game where the world is much too dangerous to explore unprepared, so data analysis and mission planning are crucial gameplay mechanics.

## Introduction
A game exactly like subnautica, except it is way more dangerous outside and a core gameplay mechanic is designing data analysis pipelines to learn about the outside world in order to plan missions, program autonomous agents to do things that are too dangerous for you to do yourself, and find your way home.

## Narrative
You start the game with a source of data telling you about whats happening outside but it's incomplete and the game dialogue introduces you to the console where you can construct your model. It introduces you to some toy problems (simple classification and regression) which you use to stabilize the life support in your ship. The ship's robot informs you that the outside atmosphere is highly toxic to you and that you are highly recommended to use your space suit if you decide to exit the escape pod.You then open the door of your ship and find yourself in a tropical island environment with lush greenery and remnants of your crashed ship all around you. The ship's computer and your engineering background allow you to fix up the broken escape pod and life support system using materials you can easy find outside, but in order to begin finding your way off the planet, you'll need to veture further into the unknown.

The dangers of this alien world are so great, you're faced with certain death unless you understand your surroundings and plan your excursions carefully. There are certain dangers which you will need to deal with quickly:
 1. When you attempted to touch the greenery, your suit began to sizzle and melt. The ships computer advised that some of the plant life on the planet must be coated with a layer of corrosive liquid.
 2. In order to escape the planet, you will need to extract ore and fuel from deep under the surface. In order to find the precious veins, you will need to make effective use of the data you can extract from the and water.
 3. After venturing deeper into the vegetation, you find predatory creatures which nearly make a meal out of you. They make sounds and can detected with a sensitive microphone, but in order to pick their sounds out from the noisy signal, you will need to develop an algorithm to process the incoming data and alert you to danger.

## Mechanics
Players interact with the world through a first-person point of view. They can walk around, observe their surroundings, and interact with nearby items. There are numerous sources of data in the environment and sensors which the player can create which all produce data while the game runs. The player can use these data sources and sensors to drive elements of their space suit GUI, components of the game world, and autonomous robots which they construct.

## Progression
The player progresses by exploring further into the alien world, collecting materials from the environment, and building a rocket to launch back into space. Along the way the player is challenged with many novel issues which can be mitigated significantly by effective data analysis. Additionaly, the player can progress significantly faster by utilizing automation (powered by data analysis) to relieve the player of demanding gameplay mechanics and enabling them to explore further. By learning good data science practices and surviving long enough in the alien wild to build a spaceship, the player completes the game and the credits roll.

## Art Assets
The game requires high quality 3D models and animations to match the visual quality of Subnautica.
