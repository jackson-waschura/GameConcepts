## Introduction
Hexed delivers a unique experience by combining destructible terrain, non-euclidean geometry, and other unusual mechanics into the player's survival tool-belt. The player spawns into a procedurally generated fantasy world empty of other people. During the day, the player explores towns, cities, and castles while they loot supplies and seek out sturdy shelter. During the night, they defend themselves from the hellscape the world becomes. Ogres, demons, the undead, and all kinds of terrors pour out into the world after sunset to wreck havoc on humanity.

## Narrative
Tell the story of the game. Who are the characters, where is the setting, and what events transpire?

## Mechanics
In Hexed, the player interacts with the game world through movement, looting, combat, and casting spells.

### Movement

### Looting

### Combat

### Spells
Spells cast by the player exhaust them and require the player to restore their energy between casts. Some spells drain energy by being cast while others will drain energy over time for the duration the spell is active. The effect of each spell is weak when first cast, but becomes stronger with more practice, both by increasing stats and by the player's casts becoming more precise.

The action of casting a spell requires the player to execute a precise mouse movement (or wand movement in VR). The movement is procedurally generated in each level, so the spells cannot be memorized across multiple runs. Additionally, a spell cannot be cast until the player finds the spellbook containing the associated instructions. Such spellbooks are found across the world in castle libraries, hidden dungeons, and enchanted forests. Potentially, some special spells require specific equipment to cast (amulets, rings, wands, etc.) Ideas for possible spells include:

#### Seeing Through Materials

#### Slowing Down Time

#### Opening Portals

#### Invisibility

#### Teleportation

#### Levitation

#### Shrinking or Enlarging Objects

#### Transmutation

#### Healing

#### Necromancy

#### Mind Control

#### Shielding

#### Flying
